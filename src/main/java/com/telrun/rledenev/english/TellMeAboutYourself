Hello, my name is Roman. I am from Belarus, now I am in Poland.
I am looking for a company that needs a Java developer.
I started learning the Java programming language in 2020.
In 2021, I got a job at EPAM Systems in Belarus.
In my portfolio there are several projects that I did completely by myself.
Unfortunately, due to the political situation in my country and in the world,
I was forced to leave the country and resign from the company.
I am responsible, attentive to details, communicative, and can easily get alone with other team members.
I am also ready to quickly learn new necessary technologies.
Less than a year has passed from the moment I started learning the Java language from scratch
to my job as a Java Software Engineer.
